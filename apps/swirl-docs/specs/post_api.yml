        ### General Setup


        For accessing the API you need the following information:


        #### DOMAIN


        This is the base of the URL of your Flip system - so this is also the
        URL that the normal users use to access Flip via the UI.

        e.g. `test.flip-app.com`


        #### TENANT


        The System ID of your Flip system. This information will be provided to
        you.

        e.g. `mycompany`


        ### How to get an OAuth token


        Because we use
        [Bearer-Auth](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/making-authenticated-requests/)
        for our API, you need to set the `Authorization` header with a valid
        token for all requests to the API. So before making any calls to the API
        itself, you need to fetch a token.


        The authentication is based on OAuth2 using the `grant_type` `password`.
        The `client_id` must be set to `external-content`. The `username` and
        `password` are the credentials of the technical user you want to use to
        sync.


        #### Example call for getting a token - make sure to replace all values
        starting with `$` with your values as mentioned above:


        ```bash

        curl -X POST --location
        "https://$DOMAIN/auth/realms/$TENANT/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
        		-d
        "grant_type=password&client_id=external-content&username=$USERNAME&password=$PASSWORD"
        ```


        #### Example response:


        ```json

        {
          <...>
          "access_token": "eyJhbG<...>",
          "expires_in": 86400,
          "token_type": "Bearer",
          <...>
        }

        ```


        You now need to store the content of the field `access_token` since it
        will be required as `Authorization` -Header in the following calls to
        the API. The token has a defined expiration, `expires_in` and can be
        used until the expiry date. So it is not necessary to get a new token
        for each call, only if the token expires, then you have to get a new
        one.


        For more information about OAuth and the grant_type client-credentials,
        see
        [https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/).


        ### Example Call to the API


        After you obtained your token in the previous step, you can now use it
        to make calls to the actual API.


        Here is an example for requesting all users, just replace `$DOMAIN` with
        your domain and `$TOKEN` with the token you obtained from the
        `access_token` field in your call to get a token:


        ```bash
            curl https://$DOMAIN/api/external/v1/sync/users --header
        'Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN' ```

      scheme: bearer
      type: http

    # Changelog


    ## 1.5-beta

    * Allow system administrators to use the Post API as well.


    ## 1.4-beta

    * A new endpoint for searching posts [GET
    api/external/post/v2/posts](#operation/getPostsV2). This allows you to get
    not only published posts, but also scheduled posts (unlike the first
    version). There are also many new filter options to cover most use-cases. In
    addition, to schedule or update the scheduled date of a post, there is a new
    `scheduled_at` field for the [POST
    api/external/post/v1/posts](#operation/createPostV1) and [PUT
    api/external/post/v1/posts/{postId}](#operation/updatePostV1) endpoints.

    * New endpoints to create [POST
    api/external/post/v1/posts/{postId}/comments](#operation/createComment) or
    remove a post comment [DELETE
    api/external/post/v1/posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}](#operation/deleteComment).

    * Add new field `send_push_notifications` to [POST
    api/external/post/v1/posts](#operation/createPostV1) for controlling if a
    post should trigger sending push notifications to the users.

    * Add new field `published_at` to endpoints [POST
    api/external/post/v1/posts](#operation/createPostV1) and [PUT
    api/external/post/v1/posts/{postId}](#operation/updatePostV1), that allows
    to manually set the published date of a post. The date must be in the past.


    ## 1.3-beta

    * Increase the payload size to `200 KiB` for endpoints [POST
    api/external/post/v1/posts](#operation/createPostV1) and [PUT
    api/external/post/v1/posts/{postId}](#operation/updatePostV1)


    ## 1.2-beta

    * Add new field `attachments` to endpoints [POST
    api/external/post/v1/posts](#operation/createPostV1) and

    [PUT api/external/post/v1/posts/{postId}](#operation/updatePostV1), that
    allows attaching to posts already uploaded data.


    ## 1.1-beta

    - Add new endpoint [POST
    api/external/post/v1/posts](#operation/createPostV1) to allow creating posts
    in a group.

    - Add new endpoints to upload files and query their background processing
    status. The endpoint [POST
    api/external/v1/attachments](#operation/uploadFile) is used for upload and
    the endpoint [GET
    api/external/v1/attachments/{attachment_id}/status](#operation/getAttachmentStatus)
    to query the status.


    ## 1.0-beta


    * Add new endpoint [GET
    api/external/post/v1/posts/{postId}/comments](#operation/getComments) to
    allow fetching the comments
      for a post. The endpoint allows for querying for comments in a certain
    time range via the `after` and `before` query
      parameters and supports pagination via cursors.
    * Endpoint [GET
    api/external/post/v1/posts/{postId}](#operation/getPostDetail) now also
    returns the `external_id` of a post.

    * Endpoint [GET api/external/post/v1/posts](#operation/getPosts) accepts new
    query parameters to filter by `external_id` and by `group_id`.
