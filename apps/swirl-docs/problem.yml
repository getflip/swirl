      title: Problem
      properties:

          description: |-
            A short summary of the problem type. Written in English and readable for engineers, usually not suited for
            non technical stakeholders and not localized.
            Opposed to the recommendation in RFC 7807 the title is likely to not contain http status code names.
          example: No user with the given id found
        detail:
          type: string
          description: |-
            A human readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem that is helpful to locate the
            problem and give advice on how to proceed. Written in English and readable for engineers, usually not suited
            for non technical stakeholders and not localized.
          example: User with id <id> was not found. Please ...
          nullable: true
        error_code:
          type: string

          type: string
