# SwirlToastProvider

The SwirlToastProvider component is used to host and create
[SwirlToast](?path=/docs/components-swirltoast--swirl-toast) messages.

- **[Source Code](https://github.com/flip-corp/swirl/tree/main/packages/swirl-components/src/components/swirl-toast-provider)**

## Usage

<Canvas of={Stories.SwirlToastProvider} sourceState="shown"></Canvas>

<Controls of={Stories.SwirlToastProvider} />

## Accessibility

### ARIA

| ARIA            | Usage                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `role="status"` | The component wraps all toasts in a "polite" live region. |

### Positioning

You should place the SwirlToastProvider component in the designated slot of the
Layout components. This ensures that the messages are displayed correctly and
guarantees that they appear at a predictable place in the DOM structure.

### Timing/Duration

Toasts can be configured to automatically close after a certain period of time,
which is in violation with WCAG 2.1. To work around this issue, we allow the
user via the UI of our app(s) to override the time period globally or disable
automatic closing completely.
