# SwirlVisuallyHidden

The SwirlVisuallyHidden component is used to hide content visually, but keep it
readable for screen readers.

- **[Source Code](https://github.com/flip-corp/swirl/tree/main/packages/swirl-components/src/components/swirl-visually-hidden)**

## Usage

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="components-swirlvisuallyhidden--swirl-visually-hidden" />
</Canvas>

In some cases, you may want to hide elements that should be readable by a screen
reader but are visually redundant. For example, icon buttons that need an
accessible label, but the icon is sufficient in the visual representation.

```html
<button>
  <swirl-icon-close></swirl-icon-close>
  <swirl-visually-hidden>Close</swirl-visually-hidden>
</button>
```

## Accessibility

The component styles its children so that they are visually hidden, but the
contents are still readable by assistive technology like screen readers. Do not
use this component to hide interactive elements.
