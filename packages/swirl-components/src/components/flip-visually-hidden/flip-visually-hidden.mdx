# FlipVisuallyHidden

The FlipVisuallyHidden component is used to hide content visually, but keep it
readable for screen readers.

- **[Source Code](https://github.com/flip-corp/swirl/tree/main/packages/swirl-components/src/components/flip-visually-hidden)**

## Usage

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="components-flipvisuallyhidden--flip-visually-hidden" />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

The component styles its children so that they are visually hidden, but the
contents are still readable by assistive technology like screen readers. Do not
use this component to hide interactive elements.
