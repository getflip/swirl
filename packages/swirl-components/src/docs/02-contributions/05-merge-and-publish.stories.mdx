# 🏁 Merge & Publish a new Library Version

All changes to the Component Library are made via Pull Requests (PRs). PRs are
assigned to at least one
[code owner](https://github.com/getflip/swirl/blob/main/CODEOWNERS).

**The review is performed according to the following checklist:**

- The changes **do not** contain any breaking changes.
- The changes **do not** introduce new components that don't belong in the
  library (e.g. non-reusable components, highly specialized components,
  components including business logic)
- A
  [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md)
  was added.
- The component documentation is updated.

  [💅 Style Guide](?path=/docs/requirements-style-guide--page).
  - The code is formatted with Prettier.

<hr />

The versioning happens on the basis of our
[changesets](https://github.com/getflip/swirl/tree/main/.changeset). Every merge
into the main branch will automatically create a versioning pull request (or
update the existing one). This PR can then be merged at any time to
automatically publish the new NPM package versions. This prevents sluggish
release cycles and makes it possible to integrate changes to the library at
short notice.
