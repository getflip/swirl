# 🆕 Create a Component

Before you create a new component, you should make sure that a similar component
does not already exist and that the component makes sense in the context of the
component library.

The library should only provide reusable UI components. Highly specialized
components, as well as components implementing business logic, should not be
part of the library.

**If in doubt, please
[create a feature request](https://github.com/getflip/swirl/issues/new/choose)
first.**

<hr />

We use [Stencil.js](https://stenciljs.com/) to implement our Web Components.
Please refer to the offiicial [documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/api) if
you are not familiar with Stencil.

Create a new branch if you want to add a new component. Except for components
that depend on each other (e.g. List and ListItem), only a single new component
should be created per branch.

```bash
git checkout -b new-checkbox-component
```

Run the following commands to create boilerplate code for a new component. The
component name has to start with "swirl-" and must be in kebab-case.

```bash
cd packages/swirl-components
yarn generate
```

The command will automatically create a new directory under `src/components`
including all necessary files for your component. Here is an overview:

| File                 | Contents                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| swirl-\*.tsx         | The Stencil class component               |
| swirl-\*.css         | The component stylesheet                  |
| swirl-\*.mdx         | Markdown documentation for your component |
| swirl-\*.spec.tsx    | Unit tests for your component             |
| swirl-\*.stories.tsx | Storybook stories for your component      |

Storybook should show your new component immediately after generation.
