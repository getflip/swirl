# ✍️ Update a Component

Our components are used in various applications. Therefore, care must be taken
when modifying existing components.

We generally try to avoid breaking changes and keep changes to existing
component APIs as limited as possible. Non-breaking changes include adding new
**optional** properties and events, or adding new property values, as well as
bug fixes and styling tweaks. Breaking changes include adding or removing
(mandatory) properties and events, and changes that fundamentally alter the way
the component works or looks.

**If in doubt, please
[create a feature request](https://github.com/getflip/swirl/issues/new/choose)
first.**

<hr />

We use [Stencil.js](https://stenciljs.com/) to implement our Web Components.
Please refer to the offiicial [documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/api) if
you are not familiar with Stencil.

Create a new branch if you want to update a component.

```bash
git checkout -b add-icon-prop-to-button-component
```

Each component has its own directory under `src/components`. For a summary of
the various component files, see
[🆕 Create a Component](http://localhost:6006/?path=?path=/docs/requirements-create-a-component--docs).

Please ensure that your changes are correctly reflected in the component tests,
documentation (.mdx file) and storybook stories.
