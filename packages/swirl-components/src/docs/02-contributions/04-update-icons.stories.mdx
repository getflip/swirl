# ðŸ–‹ Update Icons

The library automatically creates a separate Web Component for each icon. The
icons are generated from the corresponding SVG files, which are pulled from the
`@getflip/swirl-icons` package.

**The icon components should therefore not be edited manually.** Instead, the
`yarn generate` command can be used to update the icon components. In addition
to generating the code, the generator also takes care of optimizing the SVGs.

To create a new icon, the SVG file should be added to the `@getflip/swirl-icons`
package. Then install the new package version and execute `yarn generate`.

```bash
yarn generate  # then choose the "icons" option
yarn changeset # to create a corresponding changelog item
yarn build
```
