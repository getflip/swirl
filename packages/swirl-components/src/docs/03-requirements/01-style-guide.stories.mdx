# ðŸ’… Style Guide

This is a style guide for the purpose of standardizing our Web Component
development. This should be used as reference whenever you create a new
component or update an existing one.

## File structure

All components live in the `src/components`directory and consist of various
files, which are described in more detail in
[the guide to create new components](?path=/docs/contributions-create-a-component--docs).

New components are created using `yarn generate`, which ensures the correct
directory structure. Please do not deviate from the generated structure.

## Naming components

Naming of the components is done according to the rules for Web Components. They
must be written in "kebab-case" and contain at least one hyphen. To avoid name
collisions, we also prefix our components with `swirl-`.

- âœ… Valid names: `swirl-button` or `swirl-menu-item`.
- ðŸš« Invalid names: `button`, `menu-item`, `menuItem` or `MenuItem`.

Component names should be as short and concise as possible, and are always
nouns, never verbs.

Dependencies between components should be reflected in the name. For example, a
component for a list item which can only be used as a child of the list
component `swirl-list` should start with the name of the parent component. In
this case `swirl-list-item` would be appropriate.

## Code styles & formatting

Most code style rules are enforced by linting rules. Your IDE should be
configured to show [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) errors when editing code.

Code formatting is handled by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Any code that is
committed must first be formatted with Prettier. It is recommended to configure
your IDE so that formatting takes place on every save.

## Code organization

The component code should be structured so that component properties of the same
type are defined in the same code block. For example, first all @Prop
definitions, then all @Event definitions, then all lifecycle events, etc.

The `render` function should be the last block in the component code.

Types, interfaces, enums and helper functions needed for the component are
defined above the class component.

Here is an example:

```typescript
import { Component, h, Prop } from "@stencil/core";

export type SwirlButtonType = "button" | "submit";

@Component({
  tag: "swirl-button",
  shadow: true,
  styleUrl: "swirl-button.css",
})
export class SwirlButton {
  @Prop() disabled?: boolean;
  @Prop() label!: string;
  @Prop() type?: SwirlButtonType = "button";

  componentDidLoad() {
    console.log("Yay!");
  }

  componentDidRender() {
    console.log("Great!");
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button
        aria-disabled={this.disabled ? "true" : undefined}
        class="button"
        disabled={this.disabled}
        type={this.type}
      >
        {this.label}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

## CSS

We write our CSS styles structured according to the
[BEM method](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/). Here, each element of our
components gets its own class name. To keep the specificity of our selectors
low, we avoid nesting class selectors.

Because of Stencil's scoping and use of Shadow DOM, we do not need prefixes for
our class names.

Here is a structural example of a button component that includes a label and an
icon, and has different sizes:

```css
:host {
  /* ... styles */
}

.button {
  /* ... styles */

  &:disabled {
    /* ... styles */
  }

  &:focus {
    /* ... styles */
  }
}

.button--size-s {
  /* ... styles */
}

.button--size-m {
  /* ... styles */
}

.button__icon {
  /* ... styles */
}

.button__label {
  /* ... styles */
}
```
