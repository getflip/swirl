# üåç Internationalization

Flip App is translated into over 20 languages and used in different regions of
the world. Our components must be able to adapt to different localizations
accordingly.

Here are some requirements and guidelines for developing components for use in
an international context.

**Do not use static texts** <br/> All texts of our components (labels, tooltips,
etc.), whether visible or invisible, must be configurable by component props or
slots.

**Consider text expansion** <br/> Languages have different spellings, grammar
rules and typographic conventions. Text can therefore sometimes be shorter and
sometimes be significantly longer. Our components should be built to handle
varying text lengths and wrappings.

**Avoid forced formatting in CSS** <br/> Do not force capitalization through CSS
styles (e.g. in headings). Different languages have different rules here, and
these kinds of styles are difficult to override.

**Colors & Icons** <br/> The perception of colors and icons can differ depending
on the user's culture. Understanding our components should never be based on the
use of colors or icons alone.

**Value formatting**<br /> Values such as numbers, currencies and dates are
formatted differently depending on the localization. Our components must allow
the configuration of the formattings (e.g. by configuring the associated ISO
standard as Prop).
