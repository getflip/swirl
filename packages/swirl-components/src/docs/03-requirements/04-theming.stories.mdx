# ðŸŒˆ Theming

To satisfy our multi-tenant apps, all components have to be themeable. Therefore
all components must use the design tokens provided by the
[@getflip/swirl-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@getflip/swirl-tokens)
package. An overview of all tokens is provided via Figma.

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are the overarching design characteristics that are required for
creating and maintaining a design system. These are, for example, the basic
values for colors, spacings, typography, etc., which are defined globally and
maintained independently of individual components.

As mentioned before, the Swirl design tokens are provided via the
[@getflip/swirl-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@getflip/swirl-tokens)
package. It contains the tokens in all common formats for use on the web (CSS,
SCSS, Sass, Less).

An overview of all design tokens can be found in the
[Design Tokens section](?path=/docs/design-tokens-background-colors--docs), or
in the "Canvas" view of each component page.

## Themes

A theme is a defined set of design tokens. The "Light" and "Dark" themes are the
basis of all tenant themes. A tenant theme is created by overwriting specific
design tokens via our
[Theme Provider](?path=/docs/components-swirlthemeprovider--swirl-theme-provider).

| Theme | Figma                                                                                        |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light | [Light Theme Specs](https://www.figma.com/file/tdZazSM2WcgwfXvdCV3LV5/Light-Color-Tokens-V2) |
| Dark  | [Dark Theme Specs](https://www.figma.com/file/HmXvEMMerFjqgUqLeq4rjt/Dimmed-Color-Tokens-V2) |

Each component should work in combination with the "Light" and "Dark" theme. The
themes can be changed via the theme switch in the storybook canvas.

## Theme Provider

The Theme Provider controls which theme is used to display the user interface.
It takes into account the theme settings of the user's operating system and
allows the user to change the app theme. Furthermore, tenant colors can be
configured to customize the branding of the app to the customer's needs.

Have a look at the
[SwirlThemeProvider component](?path=/docs/components-swirlthemeprovider--swirl-theme-provider)
for more information.
