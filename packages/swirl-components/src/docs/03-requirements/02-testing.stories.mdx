# 🤖 Testing

With the help of tests we make sure that all components do what they are
supposed to do and changes to the code do not lead to unexpected behavior or
errors. Furthermore, we write regression tests to prevent bugs that have been
fixed from occurring again.

All components are tested using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) unit tests. We
deliberately do not define minimum requirements for code coverage, but test at
least the functionality of the external component API (attributes, props and
events), as well as the generated markup. Snapshot tests are permitted here.

**The error-free passing of all tests is a basic requirement for the merging of
code changes, and the release of a new library version.**

## Unit tests

A basic unit test skeleton is automatically generated for each component when
using the `yarn generate` command.

```tsx
import { newSpecPage } from "@stencil/core/testing";

import { FlipButton } from "./flip-button";

describe("flip-button", () => {
  it("renders", async () => {
    const page = await newSpecPage({
      components: [FlipButton],
      html: `<flip-button></flip-button>`,
    });

    expect(page.root).toEqualHtml(`
      <flip-button label=\"Label\">
        <mock:shadow-root>
          Hello World
        </mock:shadow-root>
      </flip-button>
    `);
  });
});
```

### Snapshot tests

To test the rendered markup of a component, snapshot tests can be used by adding
an empty `toMatchInlineSnapshot()` condition. On the next test run, the snapshot
will automatically generated and added to the test. It is up to you to check the
snapshot after each code change and verify that the resulting markup is correct.

Add the empty condition:

```tsx
it("renders the label", async () => {
  const page = await newSpecPage({
    components: [FlipButton],
    html: `<flip-button label="Label"></flip-button>`,
  });

  expect(page.root.shadowRoot.innerHTML).toMatchInlineSnapshot();
});
```

After the next test run the rendered markup was automatically added to the test
by Jest:

```tsx
it("renders the label", async () => {
  const page = await newSpecPage({
    components: [FlipButton],
    html: `<flip-button label="Label"></flip-button>`,
  });

  expect(page.root.outerHTML).toMatchInlineSnapshot(
    `"<button class=\\"button\\" type=\\"button\\">Label</button>"`
  );
});
```

### Testing custom events

The following example demonstrates testing a custom event, assuming you have a
component with the custom event "testEvent" that is triggered by clicking on a
button inside the component.

```tsx
it("fires", async () => {
  const page = await newSpecPage({
    components: [FlipButton],
    html: `<flip-button label="Label"></flip-button>`,
  });

  const buttonSpy = jest.fn();

  page.root.addEventListener("testEvent", buttonSpy);
  page.root.shadowRoot.querySelector("button").click();

  await page.waitForChanges();

  expect(buttonSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```
