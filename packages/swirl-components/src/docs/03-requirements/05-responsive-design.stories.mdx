# ðŸ“± Responsive Design

Our components are used on a wide range of devices and viewports. To ensure that
the user interface of our applications is usable everywhere and looks good at
the same time, we develop our components in such a way that they adapt
"responsively" to the supported devices and viewports.

We prioritize mobile devices according to the "mobile-first" principle. This is
reflected in particular in the styling of components. The standard styles of a
component always refer to the mobile viewports; media queries are used in
addition to adapt the styles for larger viewports, if necessary.

## Media queries

Media queries are used to adjust component styles for larger viewports.

| Media Query                | Condition                                                                               | Usage                                      | Description                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - none -                   |                                                                                         |                                            | Targets all viewports                                                                  |
| from-mobile                | min-width: 375px                                                                        | `@media (--from-mobile) {}`                | Targets mobile viewports and larger                                                    |
| from-tablet                | min-width: 768px                                                                        | `@media (--from-tablet) {}`                | Targets tablet viewports and larger                                                    |
| from-desktop               | min-width: 992px                                                                        | `@media (--from-desktop) {}`               | Targets desktop viewports and larger                                                   |
| from-large-desktop         | min-width: 1440px                                                                       | `@media (--from-large-desktop) {}`         | Targets large desktop viewports                                                        |
| from-desktop-without-touch | ((min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1439px) and (hover: hover)) or (min-width: 1440px); | `@media (--from-desktop-without-touch) {}` | Targets desktop viewports without primary touch input, and all large desktop viewports |

**Here is an usage example:**

```css
@import "../../styles/media-queries.css";

.flip-button {
  font-size: 1rem;

  @media (--from-desktop) {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }
}
```
