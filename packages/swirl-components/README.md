# Swirl Web Component Library

The Swirl Web Component Library provides a framework-agnostic foundation for UI
development for the Flip App. It implements a set of solid UI components that
are composable, performant, accessible and well-tested, while also satisfying
the UX and UI design requirements of the Swirl Design System.
